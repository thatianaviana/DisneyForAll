# Disney For All

### Disney For All (DFA) was created for the sole purpose of gifting deserving families with the chance to take their family to Disneyland.
                                
    We fully understand that mutliple families that live here in Southern California do not have the means to take their kids to Disney. The cost of the entrance alone is enough to burden many families.

    We are hoping that with your generosity, we will be able to provide them with one fun day in the Happiest Place on Earth!

    We'll provide the family with entrance tickets, parking fee, food and hopefully we'll have extra money so that the kids can walk away with a little souvenir to remind them of that special day.

    100% of the the money will go towards that and we'll provide you with a receipt that can be used for tax purposes.
